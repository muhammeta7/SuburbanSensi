Sometimes you go to a music festival and really enjoy a song or two from a new band but you have no way to get information on them. This site was specifically designed to get some basic info about Suburban Sensi and their upcoming events. Fans also have acess to reach out to the band through multiple platforms of social media.

## Functionality
The app uses `Boostrap`, `jQuery`, `HTML` in unison with `Node.js` and 'express` servers. Includes animations and parallax to add some pop to the page.
